        "# Unsticking Congestion Pricing Public Testimony\n",
        "<i>An analysis of the MTA's public hearing transcripts.</i><br>\n",
        "<b>Introduction</b>\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the start of the semester, the question of whether New York City would be able to implement its proposed congestion pricing toll has gone from a distant\n",
        "possibility to an undeniable reality. The whirlwind that has surrounded a Central Business District Tolling scheme in New York City begins as far back as 2007 when then Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed the toll as part of a comprehensive sustainability plan to reach ambitious climate targets, reduce congestion in the city’s core, and raise funds to improve aging transit infrastructure ([Schaller, 2010](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/schaller_paper_2010trb.pdf)). That 2007 congestion tolling proposal was never enacted and the idea has spent the better part of the last two decades between various stages of the legislative process attempting to achieve those same goals. That process seemingly reached its culmination this past summer when a 2019 proposal was set to move forward, ensuring the region’s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) could access the projected $1 billion in annual revenue the toll was expected to generate ([Regional Plan Authority, 2019](https://rpa.org/work/reports/congestion-pricing-in-nyc#who-benefits-from-congestion-pricing-everyone)). Yet, with the cameras installed, MTA projects scheduled from the newfound budget, and a plan to begin at the end of June; New York’s Governor, Kathy Hochul, made the surprise decision to ‘indefinitely pause’ the start of the toll ([Politico, 2024](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/05/hochul-announces-pause-congestion-pricing-00161759)). In the wake of the announcement, speculation swirled about the true rationale behind the governor’s choice, but by her own account the decision was based on conversations with patrons at local diners citing cost of living concerns ([New York Times, 2024](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/nyregion/hochul-congestion-pricing.html)). Since then, in November, notably after the results of the presidential election, the governor reversed her June decision in favor of a January 1st start to the toll at a reduced rate ([New York Times, 2024](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/nyregion/congestion-pricing-nine-dollars.html)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Meanwhile, the MTA had held a series of public meetings between September of 2021 and August of 2022 ostensibly to provide the public with an understanding of the program and gauge their response. The meetings, 25 in total including 19 ‘outreach’ sessions and 6 more ‘public hearings’, were targeted to a variety of communities including constituents in New Jersey, suburban counties outside of New York City, Connecticut, each of the five boroughs, and more ([Metropolitan Transit Authority, 2024](https://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP/upcoming-meetings)). All of them were then made available publicly via YouTube, some lasting as long as 4 hours.\n",
        "\n",
        "The seemingly extensive series of community engagement followed by the puzzling decision by the governor raised questions about the usefulness of community engagement for government agencies and the reaction of the public during these sessions. What was the point of holding these meetings if ultimately the governor would use her own methods of analysis and decision-making? What does it say about the efficacy of participatory government models? What was it that New Yorkers truly felt about congestion pricing? Was the public commentary aligned with the governor’s decision to pause the toll? Who from the public attended the meetings? Were the diners more representative of the region’s constituency than the meeting attendees?\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>Hypothesis</b>\n",
        "\n",
        "While these questions were of interest, finding solutions to all of them through text analysis methods would have been a fraught exercise so I limited my focus to understanding the response of attendees of the public hearings towards congestion pricing. Using topic modeling, term frequency, and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) I attempted to understand whether the public was in favor or against congestion pricing. In sum, was the conversation from the MTA’s congestion pricing public hearings supportive of the new tolling proposal?\n",
        "\n",
        "My initial hypothesis was that the public response would be more supportive towards the proposal than the governor’s reversal decision, focusing on the environmental benefits and the opportunities for improving transit. However, I was also wary of the possibility that the attendees would skew towards a small population of wealthier, more engaged car owners, not representing most residents, but confirming the governor’s decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that the governor has reversed the earlier decision to pause congestion pricing, in some ways this project has never been more irrelevant, but the analysis still offers an informative look into how text analysis can be used to investigate public hearings, offers a look into the response to congestion pricing, memorializes the MTA’s efforts to conduct public outreach, and poses new questions to consider. All of which lend support for the use of data analysis to improve public policy decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>Methods</b>\n",
        "\n",
        "To perform the analysis, I used the YouTube transcripts generated from each meeting. Using the YouTube API proved more difficult than expected compared to pulling comments from videos, like we did in class. To get around working directly with the YouTube API, I was able to find, thanks to some help from Professor Krisel, a custom open-source API library on GitHub that retrieves the transcripts without the installation of tools like headless browsers ([Depoix, 2018](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api)). Along with the API from GitHub I used the pandas library for structuring and viewing data, the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for processing the text by tokenizing each word and removing stop words, tomotopy for topic modeling, and seaborn and Vega-Altair for data visualization.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the core of the transcript retrieval script coming from the open-source API, I then identified various functions for cleaning text for analysis. The code used for removing stop words, lemmatizing or reducing the text to its root, and tokenizing or breaking the text into smaller pieces, came primarily from Rebecca Krisel’s workshop on extracting comments from Youtube video ([Krisel, 2023](https://chatgpt.com/share/290c2c82-a05d-405c-a2ce-a182eae074eb)). Once the main components were identified for data collection, I used generative AI in the form of ChatGPT and Gemini to combine the various code blocks into a series of functions.<br><br><ul>\n",
        "The prompts I used for generative AI included:<br>\n",
        "<li><i>Can you make me a function using the following YouTube transcript extraction script so I can pull transcripts over a list of multiple videos?\n",
        "Can you include the video titles in the DatFrame?</li>\n",
        "<li>Can you add to this script and include functions that will clean up the text by removing stop words and lemmatizing the text? Use these functions below to do so: (code from YouTube comment extraction workshop)</i></ul>\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "The process of solidifying the DataFrame was an iterative process. The result of the transcript extraction creates snippets of text from every few seconds of the video. The methodology for determining the duration of each snippet was unclear to me but ultimately unimportant to the overall analysis because I would group the data by video title which was the same as the meeting name and date. The iteration was mainly to update the stop words. Because the initial DataFrame was over 100 thousand rows, I determined the potential stop words by performing topic modeling and frequency distribution analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, I reduced the size of the DataFrame to remove unnecessary columns, performed a groupby, and then combined the multiple lists of text into a single list. This DataFrame is titled grouped_df DataFrame. I also created a separate dataframe with a new column that took the singular list of text and converted it into a single string block, this DataFrame is titled topic_modeling_df. The reason for creating separate DataFrames was to be able to perform the topic modeling and frequency distribution analysis more easily. I used ChatGPT to help group and format the data using the following prompts:<ul><li><i>I have the following dataframe. The column 'processed_text' is a list but I need to do a groupby on the video title combining all of the processed text. What can I do?</li><li>Now how do I take that list and make it a string separated by spaces?</li></ul></i>\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, I prepared the data for topic modeling. First, I asked ChatGPT to format the data into separate lists by video title and by video text.<ul><li><i>Now I need to use this data for topic modeling using tomotopy. How do take the two columns of data into the dataframe and put them in two lists, one called titles and the other called training data? The lists should iterate each of the 24 rows of data and add the video_title data to titles and all of the processed_text into the training data list.</li></ul></i>\n",
        "\n",
        "The topic modeling script was pulled from Rebecca Krisel’s topic modeling workshop ([Krisel, 2023](https://github.com/rskrisel/topic_modeling_workshop/blob/main/topic_modeling_tomotopy_workshop.ipynb)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the topic modeling was complete, I also performed a frequency distribution which helped to identify the most common words being used and aid in the removal of stop words. I used Gemini to take the data from the DataFrame, grouped_df, and asked it to put the text into a single list. Then I performed a simple frequency plot from the Natural Language Toolkit workshop (Krisel, 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon completing this initial setup and analysis I was able to return to the initial function and add to the stop word list. Certain pieces of text were easy to remove like words you might use in speech to break up your sentence like “uh” or “um”. I also removed common conjunctions that were being split by the process like “’s” or “’re”. Furthermore, I removed any common oddities that seemed like an error caused by the auto generated transcript process like “’m” which may have been the transcripts response to certain gaps or pauses in a person’s testimony. Next, I removed words like “new”, “York”, “congestion”, and “district” because these words were overwhelming the analysis and are not indicative of the speaker’s actual perspective on the subject but merely showing that the content of the meetings was truly about the subject matter. Lastly, I removed words like “thank”, “speaker”, and “follow” because again they were overwhelming the analysis and not providing much insight. It was very common for the moderator of the meeting to end each speaker’s section by saying, “thank you, the following speaker is…”, so these three words were very common but ultimately meaningless to the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The last form of text analysis that I performed was term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf) which is a method that tries to identify the most distinctively frequent or significant words in a document ([Krisel, 2023](https://github.com/rskrisel/tf-idf/blob/main/TF_IDF_with_Scikit_Learn.ipynb)). I chose tf-idf because I found that topic modeling provided odd or difficult to decipher topics. Using tf-idf would offer a way to supplement the topic modeling results and dig into the specific points of emphasis at each meeting.\n"

        "The initial results from performing topic modeling lend some support to the decision made by Governor Hochul. There is not a strong, clear message that shines through, however, with responses like “pricing car time live resident good”, “go people need transportation pay name”, and “people get go also tax think” lend some, albeit vague, credence to the idea that some participants felt like the needs of car owners were not being considered and that the toll would only be adding to the rising lack of affordability. At the same time, we see what could be described as support from the other side with topics like “transit percent see include project business” and “transit public reduce comment also today” which could be referring to the need for greater support and use of public transit systems. All in all, the topic modeling exercise leaves more questions than answers and doesn’t seem to definitively be able to provide a strong characterization of the prevailing commentary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at the frequency distribution we see words like “would”, “environmental”, “business”, “Manhattan”, and “central” as the most highly prevalent words in the text. These may suggest a strong emphasis towards the positive environmental impacts of the toll but could also be indicative of the fact that this is a proposed plan, hence the use of the word “would”, several of the meetings were explicitly focused on environmental justice, and that the toll is in the Manhattan’s central business district.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tf-idf analysis offers the clearest picture of the conversation at each meeting and what the main topics of interest were, categorized roughly by meeting type and target audience. First, we see that for 13 of the 25 meetings, the word “environmental” has the highest tf-idf score. While this may be a clear signal that the audience is largely in favor of the plan in lieu of the environmental benefits, it’s also important to note that 9 of these 13 meetings were specifically positioned as ‘environmental justice’ public meetings, meaning they focused on the way the program would benefit the environment and communities that have been vulnerable to various kinds of environmental issues in the past.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, although the State of New Jersey sued New York over the plan and the general perception of suburban life being car centric, the highest scoring or second highest scoring term during the meetings specifically targeted towards outer suburbs is consistently, “environmental”. Meanwhile, it seems that the meetings within the five boroughs focused mostly on the cost of the program and car traffic. The generic public hearings, which in one case lasted upwards of 9 hours show a more ambiguous result, likely because of the length of the meetings, but do seem to lean slightly towards a concern over car travel and pricing.\n",
        "\n",
        "These results seem to offer more nuance to my hypothesis but also support the idea that the meetings are represented by the car-owning portion of the public. What the analysis doesn’t seem to support is the defense offered by the Governor, that diners who have driven in from the outer suburbs to midtown are opposed to the toll. In fact, if we are to believe the tf-idf results, its these groups that seem to be most in favor of the toll while residents of the city are least in favor. A surprising result given that most New Yorkers do not own a car ([Hunter College Urban Planning, 2024](https://www.hunterurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Car-Light-NYC-Infographics-May-2024.pdf)).\n",
        "\n",
        "While this analysis offers some interesting insights, the shortcomings of this approach must be acknowledged. Without establishing a named entity recognition model, it is impossible to know who is speaking during the meeting. MTA representatives, local politicians, advocates, members of the public, and more all attended the meetings but we have no real sense of what was said by whom and when. It’s also worth noting that there are potential inaccuracies from the auto-generated transcript’s ability to decipher what the speaker is saying. Ultimately, finding meaning in the content does seem possible as does identifying clear patterns or themes. Unfortunately, given the many hours spent during the hearings, this model does not seem capable of answering what is likely the most relevant policy question, how does the public’s testimony at statutorily mandated public hearings impact the decisions of elected leaders?\n",
        "\n",
        "Out of curiosity, I re-ran the entire program with additional stop words to include “environmental”, “Manhattan, “business”, \"would\", and “central” to see if this would offer any more clarity. Doing so seems to elevate the importance of car travel and traffic concerns as well as the overall toll pricing across all of the meetings, lending more support for the Governor's decision to pause the toll than I had originally expected."
